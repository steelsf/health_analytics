        Welcome to a simple SDOH Life Expectancy Calculator!
    </h1>

    <p style="text-align:center">
        DISCLAIMER: Please note that this result is to be taken as ab illustrative example of how Social Determinates Of Health can affect
        important health outcomes. While the prediction provided below is based on real data, the outcome is only loosely connected
        to the final outcome for a number of reasons. Firstly, the data was provided at an aggregated county level and has been
        loosely translated to individual level questions for the purpose of this web application.
        Secondly, there are many factors that determine an individual's life expectancy and SDOH are only a small portion.
        All of the effects of other factors (and their possible interactions with these SDOH factors) are not taken into account.
        Outputs are representative of average outcomes provided at a county level.
        Also, please keep in mind that correlation does not mean causation. In other words, we cannot be certain that while physical
        distress causes a lower life expectancy- just that the two are correlated.
